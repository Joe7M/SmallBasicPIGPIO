## BH1750 - Ambient Light Sensor

The BH1750 is an ambient light sensor using the I2C-protocol for communication. For setting up the Raspberry Pi
for I2C and connecting the sensor please check the [example page](./example_bh1750.html).



### BH1750_Open
```
BH1750_Open()
BH1750_Open(Address)
BH1750_Open(Address, Resolution)
```
Address: optional parameter, sets the I2C address (0x23 or 0x5C), default: 0x23  
Resolution: optional parameter, 0 (low resolution) or 1 (high resolution), default: 1  

Connects to the BH1750 sensor.

```
BH1750_Open() 'opens connetion with address 0x23 and high resolution
BH1750_Open(0x5C) 'opens connetion with address 0x5C and high resolution
BH1750_Open(0x23, 0) 'opens connetion with address 0x23 and low resolution
```


### BH1750_Close
```
BH1750_Close()
```
Closes the connection to the BH1750 sensor



### BH1750_GetLight
```
I = BH1750_GetLight()
```
I: Ambient light in Lux (lx)
  
Performs a single measurement of the ambient light and returns the value in Lux.

### BH1750_SetResolution
```
BH1750_SetResolution(Resolution)
```
Resolution: 0: low resolution, 1: high resolution

Sets the resolution of the measurement.

|              | Resolution | Measurement Time |
|---------------|:----------:|:----------------:|
|Low Resolution | 4lx        | 24ms             |
|High Resolution| 1lx        | 180ms            |

```
BH1750_SetResolution(0) 'Sets low resolution
BH1750_SetResolution(1) 'Sets high resolution
```
