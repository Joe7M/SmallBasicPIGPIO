# SmallBasicPIGPIO

> I stopped the development of version 1.0 and I'm concentrating now on version 2 of SmallbasicPiGPIO
> which will bring a new API, will work in Userspace and will be compatible with the Raspberry Pi 5.
> V1.0 was tested until SmallBASIC 12.27 but might also work for newer version of SB.
